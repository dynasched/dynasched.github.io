title: Contributors' Declaration
---

DynaSched has adopted requirements based on the signed-off-by process as
described in Section 11 of the Linux kernel document on [Submitting
Patches](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html).
Each proposed contribution to the DynaSched community repository must include the
text "Signed-off-by:" followed by the contributor’s name and either email
address or Github ID. This is a developer’s certification that he or she has
the right to submit the patch for inclusion into the project, and indicates
agreement to the Developer’s Certificate of Origin:

"By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

 - The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the
   right to submit it under the DynaSched open source
   [license](https://github.com/dynasched/dynasched/blob/master/LICENSE); or
 - The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my
   knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
   [license](https://github.com/dynasched/dynasched/blob/master/LICENSE) and I have
   the right under that license to submit that work with modifications,
   whether created in whole or in part by me, under the DynaSched open source
   license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license); or
 - The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
   certified (1) or (2) and I have not modified it.

I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and
that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I
submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be
redistributed consistent with this project and the open source license(s)
involved."

Proposed contributions failing to include the "Signed-off-by:" certification
will not be accepted into any DynaSched repository. The community reserves the
right to revert any commit inadvertently made without the required
certification.
