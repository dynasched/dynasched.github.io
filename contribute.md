Dynamic Scheduler
--------------------------------------------

When considering contributing to the
[project](https://github.com/dynasched/dynasched), it is important to remember
that if you write new components (or modify existing components) for DynaSched,
they can be published independently of the main DynaSched distribution. DynaSched
utilizes a dynamic plugin system that allows it to simply slurp up any
binary plugin that is placed in the installed plugin directory. This means
that you do not have to distribute all of the DynaSched code — you can just
publish your own plugins (proprietary or otherwise) on your web page, FTP
site, etc. Users can download your plugins and add them to their existing
DynaSched installation.  Of course, we also welcome contributions to the open
source DynaSched repository! Naturally, we’re not giving out commit access to our
repository to just anyone. We do need to maintain production-quality control
on our code base. New contributors generally begin by posting pull requests
or identifying issues while they gain some experience with our practices and
become more familiar with the community.

Communication Channels
----------------------

Probably the first thing you should do is join the conversation.

 - [Slack channel](https://pmix-workspace.slack.com/archives/C04552PTXT4) for developers. You’ll
   almost always find at least one community member there.

 - Issues posted on the [PRIL](https://github.com/dynasched/dynasched/issues)
   GitHub repository corresponding to the target of your question or comment.

Contributions to Code
---------------------

Next, you should look through the source code. DynaSched is an active 
development effort — it is usually better to work with the most recent 
development version of the repository than the last stable release 
(especially for new projects). Contributions are submitted via pull 
requests against the repository on Github. All commits must contain
a "Signed-off-by" token in the commit message. This constitutes your
agreement with the [DynaSched Contributor’s Declaration](/contributors-declaration/).

Here are several typical forms of contributions to DynaSched:

 - Publish research results using your own modifications to DynaSched 
   (e.g., performance enhancements, support for new environments,
   etc.). If possible, make the code available to others.
 - Write your own components for custom functionality (e.g., an alternative
   scheduling algorithm).
 - Modify existing components for new functionality or performance enhancements
 - Suggest new functionality to the DynaSched community.
 - Provide complete bug reports and/or patches via issues and PRs. We always
   appreciate help in making DynaSched better!
 - Submit code for new functionality to DynaSched. We love code
   contributions! Keep in mind that code contributions must be robust enough
   to be suitable for widespread use.

Enough talk — we look forward to your participation!
